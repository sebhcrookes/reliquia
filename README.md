# Code Style
Look through the current source code, and see how the code is styled (where {} begin and end, for example.)
If you need to catch an exception and want to ignore it, use:
```java
try{
  //Code is here
}catch(Exception ignored){}
```
Other things:
```java
//TODO: This can be used to label things which need to be done in the future
// <-- Add a space between // and the actual comment
```
